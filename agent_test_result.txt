Blacksmith (to player):

Well, actually, I do need some help. I'm a Blacksmith here in Village A, but I'm running low on the materials I need to forge worge weapons. Specifically, I need some Werewolf claws to get started on some new projects. If you're interested, I could give you a mission to collect 5 Werewolf claws for me. Would you be up for that?

Hello there! Yes, actually I could use your help. I am a Blacksmith named Sam and I need some werewolf claws to forge some weapons. Would you be interested in helping me collect 5 werewolf claws?

That's great to hear! Here are some things you should keep in mind while hunting for werewolf claws:

1. Werewolves are tough creatures, so make sure you are well equipped with weapons and armor before heading out.
2. They tend to appear more frequently at night, so keep that in mind when planning your hunt.
3. Look for signs of werewolf activity such as paw prints, damaged foliage, or other disturbed areas in the grasslands.        

Bring me back 5 Werewolf claws and Iâ€™ll be able to use them as material to forge some deadly weapons. Once you have collected 5 claws, come back to me and I will give you something special that can aid you in your future endeavors. Good luck, and be careful out there!
